# Confessions Moderation Policy

This is the Prox2 moderation policy, which we’ve formalized to help people understand the role of the moderation process and standards we’ve decided on when reviewing confessions.

## Guiding Principle:

Create a space for respectful and productive discussion of sensitive topics and community issues.

## Why is this important?

Confessions is valuable space for this community. Prox has made people feel comfortable with sharing about sensitive topics, from mental health to thoughts on the Hack Club community. It’s allowed people to receive support in dark times, potentially saved people’s lives, and opened a channel for community members to discuss moderation policies without fear of retribution.

#confessions has grown into more than simply a space for anonymous comments. The channel has become popular for all sorts of serious discussion, from mental health, to productivity tips, to debates on controversial opinions, to advice for the COVID-19 pandemic. The channel isn’t just for anonymous discussions - it’s now mostly used as a place for serious discussions.

Of course, not everything in #confessions has been positive. We’ve seen much of the drama and contention in the community originate from #confessions, from racist hate-filled confessions, to verbal abuse, to targeted attacks. When we allow confessions that target specific people or groups, we run the risk of harming community members.

Additionally, anonymous confessions have the potential to give the impression that a belief held by a single person is held by many: for example, confessions that criticize a specific user’s behavior may make that user feel unwelcome, even if the majority of the community does not mind. Furthermore, it’s not the role of the community (anonymous or not) to police behavior. We have a code of conduct and a moderation team for a reason. Public shaming is not worthwhile.

Because Prox provides anonymity and led to conflict, the standards for what can be posted through it are more stringent than the community at large. You’re always welcome to post anything that complies with the code of conduct outside of Prox.

## The Rules

1) Confessions must always follow the code of conduct.
   Self-explanatory.

2) Confessions that are targeted at community members are never okay.

   This also applies to positive confessions about individuals, which are generally not allowed. For example, complements may make the subject uncomfortable when expressed anonymously. It may also make people feel excluded if they see some people receiving complements, but others not.

   If a confession refers to multiple people, it is targeted if the number of people invoked or reference is (approximately) less than 10.

   Exception: Confessions that criticize specific actions taken by or policies of HQ and community staff as part of their role are allowed.

4) The benefits from discussion must outweigh the risk of harm to community members.
   The desire for anonymity to express a controversial opinion does not, by itself, provide a benefit greater than the risk of harm.

   Discussions that may make community members, especially specific individuals or protected classes, feel unwelcome present significant risk of harm to the community at large, and must pass a high bar of potential benefit to the community to be approved.

   Confessions should be more than simply inflammatory or controversial. A confession that states a controversial opinion or critical opinion about a certain topic without providing a basis upon which a discussion can be had will be rejected.

   From @amogh:

   > I think the reason you think this is because a lot of times, hq confessions come through that are like “oh, xyz sucks so bad i hate it” but there’s no reasoning or explanation given. In the earlier days of Prox, these confessions would be allowed through in the hope of having a discussion, but a lot of times it would devolve into a dumpster fire or just not be productive because…there was no elaboration or basis given, and then we’d have to ask for an elaboration later on and it just wouldn’t work out that much.

5) Confessions should not detract from the value of #confessions as a space for serious and respectful discussion.
     1) Shit-post confessions (i.e. confessions designed to be funny) are allowed, but by an arbitrary quality standard: does the reviewing confessions team member find it funny enough to be valuable in #confessions? The primary purpose of #confessions is for serious discussion, and to avoid detracting from the channel’s value, we don’t want to crowd out serious discussion with noise. Of course, funny jokes are funny, and we’ll approve them at low quantity.
     2) Confessions that ask questions that would be a better fit for a place like #code  (“Help! Why does Javascript think 0.2 + 0.1 is 0.3000004?“) will be rejected. While we understand the desire for anonymity when asking code questions, especially when you’re first getting started, we have found that you will receive the best help when you ask openly.

## When reviewing confessions:

1) Confessions review team members may only accept or reject a confession. The content of the confession must not be edited, except by the original poster.
    
    1) If there are significant grammar or formatting errors that interfere with the confession’s readability, the confession should be rejected, and the CRT member should ask for changes to be made and the confession to be resubmitted in #confessions-meta.
    
    2) If the confession discusses a topic that may not be appropriate for all community members (e.g. suicide, self harm, abuse, adult content, etc), but otherwise complies with Prox’s rules, the confession should be posted in thread, with a clear content warning in the top level post.

2) Remember that confessions can always be resubmitted if content is edited to comply with our rules.

3) Decisions about confession rejects should be posted in #confessions-meta, except for shitpost or very-low-quality confessions.

4) Rejected or in-review confessions should be kept private to the review team.

5) Public confession rejection decisions should specify the rules broken.
    
    1) Never not provide any detail about how the confession itself, or what caused the rule to be broken. Confession decisions are holistic, and while it can be possible to point out specific issues with a confession, the reason for a reject/approve generally goes beyond the specific issues which can be easily discussed in a public space.
    
    2) Past confession rejection decisions have been overly specific in the hopes of expressing the specific issues with a confession without sharing the confession.
    
    3) This has led people to believe we’ve rejected confessions solely because they are in “all-caps”, although the true reason was that a confession was needlessly inflammatory and the all-caps nature of the confession worsened the issue.
    
    4) Providing simplified references to the rules broken in public, rather than more specific information, allows us to minimize the likelihood that our decisions are misinterpreted.
    
    5) Please do not express disagreement with a confession review decision in #confessions-meta. Because confessions should not be posted publicly and the community rarely has full context for confessions, extended discussion in public spaces about specific confessions serves to raise the potential for confusion about our decision making process, without providing space to focus on the details.

6) If any OP invokes a protected class, the assumption of good faith should be broken and we should ask for clarification by default and rejections should be used more liberally. This supersedes any mention of HQ or other rule.
